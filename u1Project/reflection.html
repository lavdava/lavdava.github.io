    <p>
        In this project, I believe that I have demonstrated proficiency in the content of unit one.
        I made sure to incorporate tables, lists of both types, forms, images, links, etc. 
        This webpage that I have developed is well organized and easy to read for me, making the development process much smoother.
        I also broke every part of this project into sections in order to provide readability for the user.
        User accesibility is something that I did my best to incorporate; using alt text for images, semantic tags, and horizontal rows.
        Looking back at the start of the year, I am pleasantly surprised with how much I've learned in terms of HTML, and I look forward to what is yet to come in the future.
